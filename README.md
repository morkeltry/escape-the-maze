# escape-the-maze
d3 visualisation of [puzzle in today's Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/07/can-you-solve-it-im-a-mathematician-get-me-out-of-here)

This does NOT solve the puzzle, nor does it give you clues.
Later updates may make the puzzle easier to solve. In that case, I will create a no-spoiler branch.

The player follows arrows, which rotate clockwise after player leaves them.
Will the player ever leave the maze that way?
Can you stop them?

At any time you can:
* click an arrow to rotate it (excpet while game is waiting for player to be placed)
* select 'place player' to choose a new square for the the player 
* pause / unpause

You can set arrows up before starting walking to make it harder for the player.
The harder it is for the player, the more pretty colours d3 displays at the end using its colour scaling :)
